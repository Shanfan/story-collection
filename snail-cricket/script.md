# Story Script

## Design Summary

The general script of a _Motion Comic_ follows this scruture: **Chapter > Scene > Panel > Layer**.

**ðŸª„ Chapter**  
Chapters take up an entire HTML. We move on to the next chapter by navigating to a different HTML.  

**ðŸª„ Scene**  
Scenes are the `<section></section>` within the HTML. A Scene typically occupies the viewport of the browswer.

**ðŸª„ Panel**  
Panels correspond to a typical comic panel, which includes speech bubbles and narrations.

In the browser, most likely one panel takes up one scene, but in some cases when you need to show a conseductive action panels, they may appear inside one scene.

These panels could go side by side, row by row, or they could fade in and out one after another.

**ðŸª„ Layer**  
Layers are nested inside a panel. At its bare minimum, we want to separate the speech, the narrations and the onomatopoeia from the image layer.

In some more magnificent scenes, we'd even want to separate one image into multiple layers, so that we can create the illusion of depth.

Some layers could contain visual effects such as sparkles and confetti, likely made inside `<canvas></canvas>`
